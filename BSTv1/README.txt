\f0\fs24 \cf0 Pretty ugly recursive put implementation and not a complete set of BST methods.  Goal was to quickly (quickly being the key word), throw\
together a recursive insert/put implementation which did not reset the links or return any references.  To put it another way, traverse\
tree until the insertion point is found and insert.}
